Hello, and welcome to Tools for Smart People.  First, let me introduce myself to those of you who are not familiar -- I'm Brandon Lorenz.  Currently, I hold a position as a Front End Web Developer over at the super awesome Victoria's Secret.  My job is to work with a bunch of smart people in the rapidly-paced environment of Retail.  

Now working in this high energy environment demands to keep up the tempo.  Smart people are similar in the respect that they get bored.
